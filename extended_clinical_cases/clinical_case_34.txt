##  Case Report:  Mme A.W. - Mélanocytome Médullaire Primitif 

**Patient:** Mme Antoinette W., 51 years old, with no significant past medical history.

**Presenting Complaint:**  Following a motor vehicle accident resulting in a cervical trauma with spontaneously regressing paresthesias in all four limbs, Mme W. underwent a cervical MRI. 

**Initial Imaging Findings (Figure 4):**
*  The cervical MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion consistent with a medullary contusion in the context of post-traumatic cervical injury.  
*  The lesion was initially asymptomatic.

**Radiological Follow-up:**

*  Despite the absence of radiological evolution, a discrepancy between clinical and radiological findings led to a secondary diagnosis of a cervical intramedullary cavernous malformation.
*  Annual radiological and clinical follow-up was recommended.

**Clinical Course:**

*  For four years, Mme W. remained asymptomatic.
*  She then presented with cervico-occipital headaches, blurred vision, and bilateral papillary edema upon ophthalmoscopic examination.

**Neuroradiological Findings (Figure 5):**

*  A repeat MRI revealed the previously identified lesion, now slightly enlarged, and importantly, meningeal dissemination along the entire cerebrospinal axis.

**Surgical Intervention:**
*  Surgical intervention focused on the cervical medullary lesion with a biopsy obtained.

**Histopathological Findings:**
*  Microscopic examination revealed a tumor composed of oval cells with irregular nuclei and melanin-rich cytoplasm.
*  No cyto-nuclear atypia or high proliferative index was observed.
*  Immunohistochemical staining with HMB 45 confirmed the presence of melanocytes.

**Post-Operative Staging:**

*  A comprehensive post-operative staging evaluation was performed, including dermatological consultation, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan, bone scintigraphy, and PET-scan.
*  These studies confirmed the diagnosis of a primary intramedullary meningeal melanocytoma complicated by a secondary diffuse meningeal melanocytosis, responsible for the intracranial hypertension.

**Treatment:**
*  After multidisciplinary consensus, the patient underwent cerebrospinal irradiation combined with temozolomide chemotherapy.
*  This initial treatment plan resulted in a satisfactory response with a decrease in headaches.

**Disease Progression and Outcome:**

*  Subacutely, a confusional syndrome developed, accompanied by an increase in headaches and a return of coma.
*  Two months after the initiation of chemotherapy, the treatment was discontinued due to the patient's deteriorating general condition.
*  Mme W. tragically passed away within three months of the initiation of her treatment.



**Discussion:**
This case highlights the complexities of diagnosing and managing rare tumors like intramedullary melanocytomas. 

* The initial presentation can be misleading, mimicking more common pathologies like contusions.
*  Radiological findings alone may not be sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of clinical correlation and histopathological confirmation. 

*  While multimodal treatment can be effective initially, these tumors can be aggressive with a poor prognosis.

Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the natural history and optimal treatment strategies for intramedullary melanocytomas.
